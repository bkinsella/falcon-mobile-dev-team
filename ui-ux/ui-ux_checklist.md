#UI/UX Checklist
In order to pass the Mobile Community of Excellence's (MCoE's) Certification process, your application will need to pass a UI/UX review. We have provided a checklist below that shows, at-a-glance, each of the concepts or elements we will be looking for during this review. The checklist has been broken down into three primary areas: **Foundational Elements**, **User Interface (UI)** and **User Experience (UX) & Interaction**.

The links provided throughout the checklist will give more detail or context that you may find helpful.

##Foundational Elements

| Description | YES | NO | N/A
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **1.** The app has a [clear purpose](https://github.com/dva-mcoe/general-documentation/blob/master/ui-ux-guide/mobile_design_process.md#finding-your-purpose) or task that can be described in one sentence. | | | |
| **2.** The app has a [defined audience](https://github.com/dva-mcoe/general-documentation/blob/master/ui-ux-guide/mobile_design_process.md#understanding-your-audience). | | | |
| **3.** The appropriate mobile platforms are supported based on the defined audience. | | | |
| **4.** The UI/UX is consistent throughout the app. | | | |
| **5.** The app is either branded or white-labeled. | | | |

| **2.** If the app is [white-labeled](https://github.com/dva-mcoe/general-documentation/blob/master/ui-ux-guide/mobile_design_process.md#white-labeling), there are no elements reflecting a certain brand. | | | |
| **3.** If the app is [white-labeled](https://github.com/dva-mcoe/general-documentation/blob/master/ui-ux-guide/mobile_design_process.md#white-labeling), customizable elements have been specified. | | | |
| **4.** The UI is modern and designed for the latest version of each supported mobile [platform](https://github.com/dva-mcoe/general-documentation/blob/master/ui-ux-guide/mobile_design_process.md#platforms). | | | |
| **5.** The UI aims to be beautiful and pleasing to its intended audience. | | | |
| **6.** All [Accessibility requirements](https://github.com/dva-mcoe/general-documentation/blob/master/ui-ux-guide/accessibility_guidelines.md) have been met. | | | |

| **12.** App icons for [iOS](https://github.com/dva-mcoe/general-documentation/blob/master/ui-ux-guide/setting_up_design_files.md#app-icon) and/or [Android](https://github.com/dva-mcoe/general-documentation/blob/master/ui-ux-guide/setting_up_design_files.md#high-res-app-icon) have been created and follow good design practices. | | | |
| **13.** All other required design assets for submission to [Apple](https://github.com/dva-mcoe/general-documentation/blob/master/ui-ux-guide/setting_up_design_files.md#required-assets-for-app-store) and/or [Google](https://github.com/dva-mcoe/general-documentation/blob/master/ui-ux-guide/setting_up_design_files.md#required-assets-for-google-play-store) have been created. | | | |

| **1.** [Standard gestures and interactions](https://github.com/dva-mcoe/general-documentation/blob/master/ui-ux-guide/mobile_design_process.md#using-standard-gestures-ui-elements--patterns) specific to each supported mobile platform are being utilized. | | | |
| **2.** Justification and/or positive [user testing](https://github.com/dva-mcoe/general-documentation/blob/master/ui-ux-guide/mobile_design_process.md#testing-your-application) results have been provided if custom gestures and/or interactions are being implemented. | | | |
| **3.** Interactive elements are readily apparent (not hidden). | | | |
