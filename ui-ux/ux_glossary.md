#Glossary of UX Terms#

The purpose of this document is to provide business and technical stakeholders with a glossary of technical terms related to User Experience (UX).

* **Accessibility.** The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 is a civil rights law that prohibits, under certain circumstances, discrimination based on disabilities. Section 508 of this law applies specifically to electronic and information technology.
* **Assets**. Specific graphic elements that have been sliced for developers to implement in an app (i.e. buttons, segment lines, banners, textures, etc.).
* **Brand**. Name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that distinctly identifies one seller's products from those of other sellers.* **Certification**. An external review or assessment of the quality of a particular product, normally leading to revisions if requirements aren't met.* **Design Patterns**. Normally a single component of a design that has been established as the standard. Design patterns are normally added to a repository or libary to be readily available for future use.* **Developer**. The programmer(s) in charge of writing, editing, and fixing defects within the code for any particular project.* **Devices**. A tool made or adapted for a particular purpose (i.e. smartphone, tablet, desktop computer, laptop computer, etc.).* **Display Density**. Also referred to as **Pixel Density**, the number of pixels a display can fit into a fixed physical space. The density is measured as DPI (Dots Per Inch) or PPI (Pixels Per Inch).* **Display Resolution**. The number of distinct pixels in each dimension that can be displayed (x,y). The number is determined by the width x height, e.g. 1080x1920.* **Effectiveness**. How well an interface supports the user in completing specified tasks.
* **Efficiency**. How quickly an interface allows a user to accomplish an assigned task.
* **Error Rate**. How many errors a user makes while performing specific tasks.
* **Ethnographic Research**. Observing target users in their natural, real-world setting rather than in an artificial environment, such as a lab or focus group.
* **Flat Design**. A minimalist aesthetic principle or design language currently used in various graphical user interfaces.* **Font**. A particular size, weight, and style of a typeface.
* **Heuristic Evaluation**. How well an app conforms to current standards of usability, such as recognized best practices and guidelines from manufacturers.
* **Icons**. A graphic symbol that represents some real, fantasy or abstract motive, entity or action.* **Interaction Designer**. Defines the ways in which a user can interact with a computer system and/or mobile platform. Often responsible for creating wireframes, prototypes and assisting with usability testing.
* **Learnability**. How quickly a new user can understand a user interface and accomplish basic tasks associated with a system.
* **Measurements**. The size, length, or amount of something.
	* *Text*: point (pt), ems (em), pixels (px), percent (%), scale-independent pixels (sp).	* *Dimensions*: pixels (px), inches (in), percent (%), density-independent pixels (dp).
* **Metrics**. Standards of measurement to evaluate aspects of an application.
* **Native App**. An application that is using the language of the Operating System (OS) that it is being developed for.	* *Language examples*: Objective-C, Swift, Java, etc.* **Operating System (OS)**. Software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs (i.e. OS X, Windows, Linux, Chrome OS, Android, iOS, etc.).
* **Personas.** Fictional characters created to represent the different user types within a targeted demographic, attitude and/or behaviorial set that might use a site, brand or product in a similar way.* **Product Owner**. Represents the stakeholder and is accountable for ensuring that the team delivers value to the business.* **Project Manager**. The person(s) in overall charge of the planning, execution and  closure of any particular project.
* **Prototypes**. A first or preliminary version of a design. For mobile applications or website designs, interactive prototypes are often created for user testing and to better communicate a design to developers and stakeholders.
* **Retention**. How long it takes a user, after a period of non-interaction with the system, to relearn its use.
* **Satisfaction**. Reported level of satisfaction users have with an app or system.
* **Scenarios**. Usually tied to personas and are a part of creating a story about who the user of a particular technology is, what they know and what they want.
* **Semantic Differential**. A measure of a user's reaction to stimulus words and concepts in terms of rating on bipolar scales defined with contrasting adjectives at each end (i.e. Good-3-2-1-0-1-2-3-Bad.)
* **Skeuomorphism**. When design mimics particular features from the physical objects/ornaments.
* **Stakeholder**. Also sometimes known as the *sponsor,* the person(s) with an interest in a given project. They may exert significant influence over the project's objectives and outcomes.* **Styleguides**. A set of standards for a design that provides uniformity in style and formatting.* **Tester**. The person(s) responsible for investigating an application or website's code for defects to ensure the quality of a product.* **Typeface**. A set of one or more fonts (font family) that share common design features.
* **User Interface (UI)**. The means by which the user and a computer system interact.
* **Usability**. How easy a user interface is to use.
* **Usability Testing**. Tests with real users that determine how easy a user interface is to use.
* **User Groups**. A group of application users who share a particular set of characteristics. For instance, patients, caregivers, nurses and doctors could represent four user groups using an application.
* **User Researcher**. A discipline that aims at improving or understanding the usability of products by incorporating experimental and observation research methods to guide the development of a product.* **User Stories**. High-level definition of a requirement as part of the Agile methodology that captures what a user needs to accomplish their goal(s).* **User Experience (UX)**. The overall experience a person has while using a product such as a website, mobile application, computer application, etc.
* **UX Assessment**. An evaluation of an applicationâ€™s usability based on both heuristic evaluation and user testing.
* **Visual Designer/UI Designer**. Responsible for creating comps/visual designs and preparing individual assets for any particular project.
* **Visual Design Comps**. The layout of a proposed final draft of a design that is initially presented by the designer to the client/stakeholder. If approved, it is used as a guide for further design changes and production.
* **Wireframe**. An image or set of images which display the functional elements and structure of a website or mobile app. Since wireframes are usually static, annotations are often used to describe the interaction of elements on a screen and/or what happens when a user interacts with those elements.
