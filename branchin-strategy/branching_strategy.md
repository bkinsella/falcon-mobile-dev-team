# DaVita MCOE Branching Strategy

This guide presents a recommended approach for managing git branches during development, testing and release of mobile applications.

#### TABLE OF CONTENTS

* master
* development
* qa
* hotfix
* features
* examples
* reference

## master

- what is currently IN production (we need to define what production means)
- never pushed directly into
- merged from a qa/release branch using pull request

## development
- what is currently DONE in a development sprint
- merged from feature branches at end of sprint
- merge party where pull requests are reviewed / accepted / modified / etc

## qa / [release]

- qa branch for integration testing of development
- created straight from development branch after a sprint
- pull requests allowed during sprint but canâ€™t be closed until merge party
- any pull requests reviewed must also be considered for development branch merging as well
- if release ready for production, a pull request to master is performed
- once pulled into master, the master branch is tagged and the qa branch is killed during merge party

## hotfix / [release]
- branch to track hot fix that needs to be made in production
- this branch can be pushed directly into and qa tested from
- once ready, a pull request to master is performed
- once pulled into master, the master branch is tagged and the hot fix branch is killed during merge party

## feature [kind] / [owner] / [description]

- feature branches where pushes can be made to directly
- owner is the team member responsible for the branch
- SCRUM testing can be done from this branch
- at end of sprint, pull request to development branch is made (or qa_<release> branch as appropriate)
- branch must die after merge party unless it is not merged and if team agrees it can stay
- kind should reflect the branch where the feature/fix will be merged TO. The kind should be
one of the following: dev, qa, hotfix
- kind may also refect an experimental branch that will never be directly merged into another
branch. These branches should begin with the kind of experiment

## examples

* development
* dev/house/super_cool_new_feature_us1221
* dev/boris/another_cool_feature_us1432
* qa/release_1_1
* hotfix/release_1_0_1
* qa/boris/defect_fix_1234
* hotfix/house/fix_oops_bug
* experiment/house/evil_genius_stuff_here


## reference

This guide is similar to the gitflow approach from this article.
